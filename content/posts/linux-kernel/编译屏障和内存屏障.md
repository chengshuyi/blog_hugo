Explicit kernel barriers.

     - Compiler barrier.
     - CPU memory barriers.

here's a significant difference - the first option (inline asm) actually does nothing at runtime, there's no command performed there and the CPU doesn't know about it. it only serves at compile time, to tell the compiler not to move loads or stores beyond this point (in any direction) as part of its optimizations. It's called a SW barrier.



Processor #1:

 while (f == 0);
 // Memory fence required here
 print x;

Processor #2:

 x = 42;
 // Memory fence required here
 f = 1;
