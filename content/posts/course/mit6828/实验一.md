The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments in this course are distributed using the [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) version control system. To learn more about Git, take a look at the [Git user's manual](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html), or, if you are already familiar with other version control systems, you may find this [CS-oriented overview of Git](http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/) useful.

If you are not already familiar with x86 assembly language, you will quickly become familiar with it during this course! The [PC Assembly Language Book](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf) is an excellent place to start. Hopefully, the book contains mixture of new and old material for you.

*Warning:* Unfortunately the examples in the book are written for the NASM assembler, whereas we will be using the GNU assembler. NASM uses the so-called *Intel* syntax while GNU uses the *AT&T* syntax. While semantically equivalent, an assembly file will differ quite a lot, at least superficially, depending on which syntax is used. Luckily the conversion between the two is pretty simple, and is covered in [Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html).

Full information about this format is available in [the ELF specification](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/elf.pdf) on [our reference page](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html), but you will not need to delve very deeply into the details of this format in this class. Although as a whole the format is quite powerful and complex, most of the complex parts are for supporting dynamic loading of shared libraries, which we will not do in this class.

The BIOS is responsible for performing basic system initialization such as activating the video card and checking the amount of memory installed. After performing this initialization, the BIOS loads the operating system from some appropriate location such as floppy disk, hard disk, CD-ROM, or the network, and passes control of the machine to the operating system.

**Exercise 2.** Use GDB's si (Step Instruction) command to trace into the ROM BIOS for a few more instructions, and try to guess what it might be doing. You might want to look at [Phil Storrs I/O Ports Description](http://web.archive.org/web/20040404164813/members.iweb.net.au/~pstorr/pcbook/book2/book2.htm), as well as other materials on the [6.828 reference materials page](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html). No need to figure out all the details - just the general idea of what the BIOS is doing first.

First, the boot loader switches the processor from real mode to *32-bit protected mode*, because it is only in this mode that software can access all the memory above 1MB in the processor's physical address space.

Second, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk by directly accessing the IDE disk device registers via the x86's special I/O instructions.



When the linker computes the memory layout of a program, it reserves space for *uninitialized* global variables, such as `int x;`, in a section called `.bss` that immediately follows `.data` in memory. C requires that "uninitialized" global variables start with a value of zero. Thus there is no need to store contents for `.bss` in the ELF binary; instead, the linker records just the address and size of the `.bss` section. The loader or the program itself must arrange to zero the `.bss` section.
